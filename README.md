# Brain.JS Experiments

These are a series of brain.js experiments that I have made. One of them is for counting down from 10, and one of them is for determining the brightness (light/dark) of an input color object.

## Usage

### HTML Experiments

Run

> npm run start

in your terminal to run the live-server for any of the html experiments (such as the rgb brightness example).

For the brightness example, you can enter three color values that range from 0 to 1.0 (red, green, and blue).

### Counting

Run

> npm run count 10 9 8 7

in your terminal to run the count example. It requires you to enter a set of numbers to start from. In this example, I entered 10, 9, 8, and 7 (separated by spaces), and it gave me 6. Obviously, 6 is the next number found when counting down from 7.
